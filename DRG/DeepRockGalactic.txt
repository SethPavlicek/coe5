[h1]Summary[/h1]

Do you like dwarves but wish they had guns, robots, and cute insect pets? Do you think that the vanilla dwarves sit in their mines until the end of the game?
If you answer yes to any of these, then this the mod for you!

This mod adds a new class with new monsters and rituals based on the game Deep Rock Galactic. There are four different dwarves each with two subtypes, quite a few robots, three new insects, and a few unique monsters.

[h1]Feature List[/h1]
Dwarves:
[list]
    [*]Scout: A fast stealthy unit meant to take out elite troops.
    [*]Driller: Burns his enemies to the ground (great for crowd control).

    [*]Engineer: Summons turrets and shoots purple beams or explosives.
[/list]

Insects (Glypids):
[list]
    [*]Glyphid Swarmers: Super wimpy and tiny units meant to swarm the enemy.

[h1]Balance and Defects[/h1]
    [*]We tried to balance this in relation to the Complete Overhaul mod (by Commisar Jon).
    [*]This class seems to get powerful late game, but it is hard to compare it to all other late-game builds.
    [*]Feedback is welcome -- either balance issues or defects. Please let me know!

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
    Your previous saved games will most likely break if you enable this mod. No other issues are known.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
    I pulled most of the images off the internet.
    Thank you to Commisar Jon for his mining rituals from the dwarf overhaul (we borrowed them for ours).
